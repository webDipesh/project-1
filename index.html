                <h2>Light OF Asia</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Gautam Buddha, also known as Siddhartha Gautama</b>, is often referred to as the "Light of Asia"
                    due to
                    his profound influence on the continent and the spread of Buddhism. Born in Lumbini, Nepal, around
                    the 6th century BCE, he is celebrated for his wisdom and compassion, which led him to seek
                    enlightenment after witnessing the sufferings of humanity. His teachings, which include the Four
                    Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, emphasize the cessation of craving as the path to
                    liberation and enlightenment. Buddha's life and philosophy were popularized by Sir Edwin Arnold's
                    poem "The Light of Asia," which introduced Western readers to his teachings and the significance of
                    Buddhism in Asia.
